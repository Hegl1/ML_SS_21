# ML_SS_21

Project made for "PS Machine Learning", university of Innsbruck, SS2021

## Summary

The task was to build a classifier that can distinguish different pictures of sign language gestures

## Original Task

Read the following information carefully!

There are three different datasets that you can choose from and in this pre-release we make them available through OLAT together with Notebooks that show how to load the datasets. Basic information about the datasets is provided in the notebooks.

You will then have to decide which dataset you want to work on and put that in the FramaDate (here: FramaDate) -- this will be fixed after Friday 16th April but you are allowed to change your preference till the Friday 16th April as many times as you want.

Please indicate your group in the name column of the FramaDate in the following way:
"Group0 - Firstname1 Lastname1 - Firstname2 Lastname2"

This is relevant because we will have Leaderboards where your implementations compete against each other - across all groups. There will be separate leaderboards for each dataset and the top ten ranked solutions of each leaderboard will receive Bonus Points.

Bonus Points based on Leader Board Rank.

To decide which method you want to implement look at >=2 different methods using SciKit or another pre-implemented method and test the method on the dataset. This is just to let you get an idea of what works on the dataset and spare you the trouble of implementing an inferior method.

Then you have to implement your chosen method yourself, in a fashion similar to the weekly notebooks, using similar tools (such as numpy, torch, etc. and not complete implementations of classifiers/regressors/etc.). Tools to investigate, preprocess or analyse can be used also from SciKit. If in doubt ask on the forum as described below.

You need to be able to store and load your model (weights/parameters) from a file, so that it can be evaluated without retraining. The maximum allowed size for your stored model is 50MB. Hence you should try to build a model that is as small as possible while being accurate enough for the dataset you chose. 

A very first version of your solution (based on scikit or the dummy classifier) has to be handed in by 2021-05-23.
This is primarily to test the submission system and will not influence the grade.

An intermediate version of the code (i.e. your own implementation, at least as good as the dummy ML method & correct implementation of the leaderboard prediction function has to be handed in, at the latest, by the end of 2021-06-06.
Here you have to hand in the notebook that loads the stored model weights and performs the prediction (to implement the leaderboard prediction function).

Finally, you will have to write a report about the project (following the template we provide). You will be graded based on the report, but you will also have to provide your implementation as a prerequisite and points will be deducted if the code does not clearly show your implementation.

The final code hast to be handed in at the latest by 2021-06-30 & the report has to be handed in at the latest by: 2021-07-02, one week after the PS finishes.
This includes the notebook that loads the stored model weights and performs the prediction,
as well as the code to train the model. Note that you have to provide your own implementation, and that
a ready-made ML model will not be accepted and 50% of the points will be deducted.

If you have questions on the Project, please ask them in the OLAT forum thread Forum Link.

Further details will follow, for new, please start investigating the datasets and deciding which ones you want to work on!
Best regards,

Your PS Team.
